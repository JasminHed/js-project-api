# Fullstack API Project 

Live Demo: https://apifrontback.netlify.app/

Overview
A complete fullstack application featuring both frontend and backend development. This project demonstrates how to build a React frontend that communicates with a custom backend API. It was my first dive into fullstack development, teaching me how different parts of a web application work together - from user interface to database interactions.

Tech Stack
Frontend: React, Vite, JavaScript (ES6+)
Backend: Node.js, Express
Database: MongoDB
Styling: CSS3, Flexbox/Grid
Deployment: Netlify (Frontend), Render (Backend)
Version Control: Git/GitHub

Features
Interactive React frontend with modern UI
RESTful API endpoints for data operations
Real-time data synchronization between frontend and backend
User authentication and session management
CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
Responsive design for all devices
Error handling and loading states

Setup Instructions
Run locally:
bash# Clone the repository
git clone [your-repo-url]
cd fullstack-api-app

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
Note: Backend server configuration may be required for full functionality

What I Learned
Building React applications with modern hooks and state management
Creating RESTful APIs with proper HTTP methods
Database integration and data modeling
Frontend-backend communication and API design
Authentication and security best practices
Deployment strategies for fullstack applications
